# TEST EventEmitter package and comparing async vs sync processes.

On sync process we need to use emitAsync and the result will be:

On async process we want to process request asynchronously to process multiple events and we should use just emit, and the result will be:

So, we noticed that when we process the calls using `emitAsync` the processes are being processed and the next emit will be emitted once the first one has been finished in the same queue, but this does not mean that they will processed like in a queue, if we emit multiple emitAsync they will be running in multiple threads, so keep in mind the rate limit, so in this case is better to consider a queue system like Bull with Redis or Mqtt.
